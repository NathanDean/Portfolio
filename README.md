# Portfolio v1 

## What 

My first portfolio site, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Express. 

## Why 

I started building this site as part of a web development course.  However, I decided to push myself by creating some features that would test my skills, which meant that I continued working on the project for a few weeks after I finished the course. 

## How 

I designed the site in Figma, creating desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile variations.  Then I built an initial version using HTML and CSS, before using JavaScript to add animated effects on the Index and Work pages.  I spent a particularly long time on DOM manipulation of the items in the grid on the Work page, to change their transform-origin property depending on their place in the grid.  I also wrote a lot of additional CSS to make the site responsive. 

The site also has a Node.js and Express back-end, which is mainly used to send email from the contact form via Nodemailer. 

## What I learnt 

This was an amazing project to work on, and I was so proud of the results.  Although I’ve since reassessed this project and decided to remake the site, creating it was a brilliant experience that helped me to understand how CSS and JavaScript work, and gave me more confidence in my ability to tackle problems that force me to go beyond my current skillset. 

When building something similar in future, I would certainly consider whether the effects I achieved with CSS and DOM manipulation were worth the time and effort I put into them on this project.  However, I’m really glad I approached this project in the way I did, because struggling with these tricky design and DOM manipulation problems – coming up against a brick wall, researching and trying new approaches, then understanding what was happening and developing a solution – was invaluable in improving my understanding of CSS and JavaScript, and helped me to become a much better developer.
