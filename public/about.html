                        <p>
                        
                            I’m a front-end developer focussed on JavaScript and React, with an in-depth understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as excellent communication and project management skills developed in previous creative roles.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            I recently completed a bootcamp with the Institute of Coding via Bath Spa University, and have since worked on several projects to improve my skills designing and developing larger and more complex apps.
                        
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>

                            I’m coming to development from a background in communications, with roles in the media teams at <a href = "https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/"">Arts Council England</a> and <a href = "https://avalonuk.com/">Avalon Promotions</a>, giving me experience in both a large public organisation and a dynamic, tight knit agency. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            Throughout my career I’ve worked closely with senior management and high-profile clients on large-scale projects, combining an innovative approach to problem solving with clear communication to achieve project goals while managing multiple pieces of work with competing deadlines.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            These are experiences that I plan to bring to my new career in tech, and I have a huge drive to improve my skills further and experiment with the ways that technology can address real world challenges.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            Outside of work I perform improvised comedy.  Besides being a lot of fun and giving me something to talk about at parties, it’s also helped me become a strong and supportive team player, as well as more adaptable, creative and comfortable with speaking and presenting. I’m always happy to meet and build relationships with new people, and very much thrive as part of a lively and cooperative team. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            I'm now looking for my first professional developer role where I can use these skills and experiences to contribute to a team, while learning from colleagues and taking on more challenging work as I progress. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            So, if I sound like a good fit for your team or project, please <a href="contact">get in touch</a>. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            Hope to hear from you soon.
