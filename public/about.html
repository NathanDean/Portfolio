                        <p>

                            I'm a front-end developer, focussing on JavaScript and React with additional experience in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Git/GitHub and Figma.  I completed a bootcamp course with Bath Spa University earlier this year, and since then have completed several online courses and personal projects to continue developing my skills.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            I'm transitioning into tech from a background in communications, having worked in the PR teams at <a href = "https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/"">Arts Council England</a> and <a href = "https://avalonuk.com/">Avalon Promotions</a>, giving me extensive experience in both a large public organisation and a dynamic, tight knit agency.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Throughout my career I've worked with senior management and high-profile clients, honing my organisation and communication skills by writing speeches and reports, pitching to journalists, and developing media strategies for a range of public-facing projects.  These are skills I plan to apply to my new career, combined with a drive to improve my technical skills and take on bigger and more complex challenges as I progress.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            So, if you're looking for an ambitious, self-motivated developer who can fit smoothly into a team, communicate clearly, and learn new skills quickly, then I'd love to hear from you.  If I sound like a good fit for your team, please <a href="contact">get in touch</a>.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            Hope to hear from you soon.

                        </p>
