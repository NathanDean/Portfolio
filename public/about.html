                        <p>

                            I'm a JavaScript and React developer with additional experience in Redux, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.  I have an in-depth understanding of HTML and CSS as well as excellent communication and organisational skills developed during my previous career in PR and media.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Since completing a bootcamp course earlier this year I've built several large-scale personal projects to continue developing my skills, and I'm now looking for a junior developer role where I can put these skills into practice while continuing to learn, with the opportunity to take on more challenging work as I progress.
                        
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>

                            I’m coming to development from a background in communications, with roles in the media teams at <a href = "https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/"">Arts Council England</a> and <a href = "https://avalonuk.com/">Avalon Promotions</a>, giving me experience in both a large public organisation and a dynamic, tight knit agency. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            Throughout my career I’ve worked closely with senior management and high-profile clients on large-scale projects, combining an innovative approach to problem solving with clear communication to achieve project goals while managing multiple pieces of work with competing deadlines.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            These are skills that I plan to bring to my new career, alongside a drive to learn more and experiment with the ways that technology can address real world challenges.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            Outside of work I perform improvised comedy.  Besides being a lot of fun and giving me something to talk about at parties, it’s also helped me become a strong and supportive team player, as well as more adaptable, creative and comfortable with speaking and presenting. I’m always happy to meet and build relationships with new people, and very much thrive as part of a lively and cooperative team.
                        
                        </p>

                            So, if you're looking for an ambitious, hard working junior developer who wants to get stuck into a challenge then I'd love to hear from you.  If I sound like a good fit for your team or project, please <a href="contact">get in touch</a>.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                            Hope to hear from you soon.

                        </p>
